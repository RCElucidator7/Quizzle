Project
--------
This is a project for mobile app development for 3rd year software development.
We were required to develop a Universal Windows Project (UWP) using C# and xaml.

Requirements
------------
• Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.

• Uses local/roaming storage for storing data and/or settings that are necessary for or 
enhance this user experience.

• Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices
Accelerometer, gyroscope, location services, sound, network service (connect to 
server for data), camera, multi touch gestures

• The app must be more than a simple information app.  It must have interactivity as part of 
the design

Overview:
------------
Quizzle is a colour guessing game where the user must select the colour that correlates
to the word that is presented on the top of the screen. Be aware as the colours of the words 
will also change and confuse the user. There is also a timer bar that counts down, the user 
must choose the right colur before it reaches zero. If it does reach zero then its game over. 
The user can edit the speed of the timer in the options tab on the main menu to make it easier 
or more difficult. The options menu also contains instructions for the user. You lose when the 
timer reaches zero or you select the wrong colour. This app challenges the user to get a high 
score, it also stores this score so the user can continue to top their previous scores.

Installation:
---------------
To install this app from this github repo, the user must navigate to the folder they wish 
to store it in on the command prompt and enter the following.
	
	git clone https://github.com/RCElucidator7/Quizzle.git

Running the app through Visual studio
-------------------------------------
To run the app through visual studio, first launch visual studio (2017 edition is recommended) and 
open the folder with the cloned project. Go to the top left of the visual studio window click file, 
open and open folder. Once opened navigate to the top of the page and click "Local Machine". Visual 
Studio should build the application and it should run on your machine. Sound and touch/click are required 
to play this game so make sure your machine has these hardware requirements in order to test this game.
